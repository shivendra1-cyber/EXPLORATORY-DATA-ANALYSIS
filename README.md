# EXPLORATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS
# Car EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

This Jupyter Notebook provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of car data using Python libraries. The analysis focuses on fuel type, engine type, model, and mileage to gain insights into the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the "Cars Data" dataset, which can be found in the [data/](data/) directory of this repository. The dataset includes information about various car attributes, such as make, model, year, fuel type, engine type, mileage, and more.

## Python Libraries Used

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.
- `scipy` and `statsmodels`: For statistical analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.

## Analysis Steps

The EDA in this notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning:** The data is checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers using `pandas`. Any necessary data cleaning steps are performed to ensure data quality.

2. **Data Visualization:** Various data visualization techniques are employed to understand the distribution and relationships between different variables. This includes histograms, scatter plots, and box plots using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

3. **Statistical Analysis:** Basic statistical analyses are performed to gain insights into the dataset. Descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, and hypothesis tests are conducted using `scipy` and `statsmodels`.

4. **Exploration by Categories:** The data is explored based on the following categories, leveraging the `pandas` library for data manipulation:
   - Fuel Type
   - Engine Type
   - Car Model
   - Mileage

5. **Insights:** The findings and insights derived from the analysis are summarized in this notebook, highlighting any interesting observations, trends, or patterns.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- `notebooks/`: This Jupyter Notebook, along with any additional notebooks for in-depth analysis.
- `results/`: Any output or visualizations generated during the analysis are saved here.
- `README.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook for documentation.

## Getting Started

To replicate this EDA or explore the analysis further, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the necessary Python libraries using `pip` or `conda`.

```python
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels numpy
